# Antenna-Length-Calculator
Antenna Length Calculator

Antenna Length Calculator is a web application used to help radio amateurs, short wave listeners, CBers, and others build common antennas, such as dipoles and verticals. The dimensions of a selected antenna is calculated based on the type of antenna chosen, and the center frequency of the desired band. The project is still under development, but a functional release will be coming soon. The code is available for review, specifically by Get-Coding coaches.
