Antenna Length Calculator is a simple web application used to help radio amateurs, short wave listeners, CBers, and others build common antennas, such as dipoles and verticals. The dimensions of a selected antenna is calculated based on the type of antenna chosen, and the center frequency of the desired band. Perfered units can also be selected. When all required information is entered, an image of the antenna is generated with dimensions and an appropriate background image for visual scaling.
